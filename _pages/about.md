<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I'm Xupu Hu, a master's student at Nanjing University of Science and Technology, advised by Dr. [Ming Zhou](hhttps://teacher.njust.edu.cn/wlkjaq/zm/list.htm) and Prof. [Peng Zhang](https://teacher.njust.edu.cn/wlkjaq/zp/list.htm). 

I specialize in **systems** and **firmware security**. During my master's studies, my research focus was on **live patching technologies for embedded systems**. Additionally, I have a research interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve traditional challenges in the field of program analysis and to build efficient and intelligent binary program analysis tools. I am building a secure and reliable automated live patching system.


📣 I am seeking <span style="color: red;">PhD</span> opportunities for September 2026.🥺

Here are my [[CV-PDF](/paper/CV_26_Fall_Phd_XupuHu.pdf)] and [[中文简历](/paper/呼栩朴中文学术简历.pdf)] for your reference, last updated in Aug. 2025.

Hello, I'm Xupu Hu, a master's student at Nanjing University of Science and Technology, advised by Dr. [Ming Zhou](hhttps://teacher.njust.edu.cn/wlkjaq/zm/list.htm) and Prof. [Peng Zhang](https://teacher.njust.edu.cn/wlkjaq/zp/list.htm). 

I specialize in **systems** and **firmware security**. During my master's studies, my research focus was on **live patching technologies for embedded systems**. Additionally, I have a research interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve traditional challenges in the field of program analysis and to build efficient and intelligent binary program analysis tools. I am building a secure and reliable automated live patching system.
